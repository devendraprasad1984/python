Compute number of distinct values in an array.
Programming language:  Spoken language:
def solution(A)
that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct values in array A.
For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:
 A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
 A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1
the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].
